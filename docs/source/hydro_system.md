# The Hydro System

The hydro system is represented as a graph, where the nodes in the graph is represented by reservoirs, creeks, power stations, gates and sinks. Connecting the nodes are edges, where flow of water is represented by discharge, spillage and bypass. The implementation of these objects can be found here: {doc}`hps.edges <./hps.edges>` and {doc}`hps.nodes <./hps.nodes>`.
